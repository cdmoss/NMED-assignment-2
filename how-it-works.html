                <br>
                <p>Bitcoin, at the highest level, is a public ledger that records transactions between members of the network. There aren't actually any "coins" persay, as the name implies, instead the network keeps track of who owns what through an unbroken chain of "blocks" of transactions at are linked together cryptographically in chronological order - called the blockchain.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Satoshi designed the blockchain's cryptographic foundation such that the validity of the chain can be easily verified by any user of the network, avoiding the need for any trusted central party (this has given rise to the popular motto "trust, don't verify" among bitcoin users).</p>
                <br>
                <p>To illustrate how Bitcoin actually keeps track of who has what, the classic hypothetical that's been used is a financial relationship between "Bob" and "Alice". Bob has some bitcoins, and wants to send a portion of his wealth to Alice on the Bitcoin network</p>
